A script to generate instrument response automatically.

After you download this script, you should first uncompress the DAS_RESP_Pool and Sensor_RESP_Pool.

In this folder, you can generate automatically instrument response polezero files using resp2pz.py or makePZs.py 
once fill a excel sheet, /DAS_RESP_Pool/das_used.lst, /Sensor_RESP_Pool/sensor_used.lst based on your project log. 
The former can take responses of sensor and DAS into consideration, it will merge them into one PZ file. 
And both das_used.lst and sensor_used.lst are required.
While, the latter only take the response of sensor into consideration, 
then genertes corresponding PZ files automatically. Thus, only sensor_used.lst is required.
